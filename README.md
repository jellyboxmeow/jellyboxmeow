- 👋 Hi, I’m @jellyboxmeow
- 👀 I’m interested in some reasearch projects that have a main focus in
  computer science, either programming languages/networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the programming language of c++, however
  I want to look into different programming languages like python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on really anything that is maybe video
  game or just really challenging problems
- 📫 How to reach me is through github and messaging if github has it.

  Thank you for listening to my intro, I am excited to start doing more on this
  platform!! :D
